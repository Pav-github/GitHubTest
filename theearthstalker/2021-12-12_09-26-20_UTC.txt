2021 has been a brilliant year for us!

Started the year with getting ourselves another house and here we are ending 2021 by traveling, we feel so blessed! 

After almost 2 years we could make it to our long overdue trip to Maldives. We crazily drove to Goa for a long weekend, had delicious seafood. Took a handful of offbeat weekend trips to Satara, Kolhapur and Lavassa in Maharashtra. We celebrated our birthdays in Kashmir. I experienced snowfall for the FIRST TIME. Oh 2021, we are grateful we could travel again! ☃️✈️

And and and .. we are grateful to have each other. 💙
