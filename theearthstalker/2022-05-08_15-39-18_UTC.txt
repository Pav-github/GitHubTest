All I want to do is, TRAVEL! 🙈

Just back from a long vacation and I’m already planning another one (In my head)! Hoping that my boss doesn’t really read this caption. 😂😂😂😂

But guys, You Only Live Once! So, I’m gonna plan a trip soon. And you do it too! If you aren’t doing what you love, are you even living it the right way?

As for me, as much as I love to travel, I love to see others travel too! I am super excited when I’m at the airport or on a vacation or even out for a weekend getaway. And equally happy and overwhelmed when I see my folks make it to their dream destinations. Over these years, we have helped SO many friends and relatives with their travel plans, itineraries, bookings etc. Only and only because I’m forever happy seeing people travel and make the most of their much deserved holidays. 

Trust me - it feels so so good to see people travel to a place and thank us for the recommendations. So if you love to travel, do it now!! Save up, take short trips, live that life you’ve always wanted to. It’s beautiful out there!! ☺️❤️
