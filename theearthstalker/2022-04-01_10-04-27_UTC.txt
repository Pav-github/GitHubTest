Thank you for the beautiful comments and DMs on this attire. Tbh, I’ve never worn a dhoti-kurta before. I ordered this online and the parcel arrived hours before we left for Rajasthan. So, I quickly shoved the unopened parcel in my bag and we left for our trip. (To state the obvious, I ALWAYS overpack) 😝

One morning in Udaipur, I opened this parcel and was so skeptical about wearing it. Relied on @frank8rohan and @deepika.indulkar ‘s opinion and I wore it. Trust me it was so so comfortable! 😂

And as you see, the pictures are 😍😍
