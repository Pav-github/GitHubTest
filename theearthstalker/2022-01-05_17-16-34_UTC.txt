Experience a floating paradise in Srinagar ⛴️

One of the biggest tourist attraction in Srinagar are their houseboats in Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake. They have a next level vibe and give a unique stay experience. ⭐

Some of the most recommended houseboat stays in Srinagar are:

1. Sukoon Houseboat
2  The Mughal Palace Houseboat
3. Peacock Houseboat
4. Naaz Kashmir Houseboat
5. New Jersey Houseboat

One night stay at a house boat can be as cheap as INR 1,500. The amenities and services provided may vary though. Made up of wood, most of these houseboats are as old as 100 years or more. 🌲

Do not confuse these houseboats with the one in Alleppey, Kerala. Srinagar's houseboats are luxury abodes, surrounded by mighty mountains and anchored in a peaceful lake. 🗻
