From writing clich√© love letters to sending postcards from the world's highest post office, we've come so far, and my heart overflows with love and gratitude. üíï

Here we are, nestled among the majestic Himalayas, surrounded by awe-inspiring beauty, celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary and 12 years of togetherness at the world‚Äôs highest post office. As we stood in that quaint little post office, we couldn't resist sending postcards to our near and dear ones, including our fur babies, Simba and Benji. It was a way for us to share a glimpse of our extraordinary adventure in Spiti, a moment frozen in time that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.

But beyond the postcards and the breathtaking scenery, what truly fills our heart is the love we share. Our love has grown deeper with each passing year, and we are grateful every day for the privilege of being partners in this incredible journey called life.

So here's to us, to the memories we've made, the dreams we've chased, and the love that continues to grow between us. We treasure every moment with each other, and look forward to many more years of togetherness, as we continue to create our own unique love story, filled with moments that take our breath away. ‚ô•Ô∏è
