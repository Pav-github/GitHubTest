Sky above, sea beneath and peace within!! 🌺

We first booked our flight to Maldives in April 2020, and rest is history!! 🙆🏻‍♀️ Couldn't believe we were actually traveling until we checked in to our beautiful island resort and unwound. Too many hiccups and change of itinerary all the way, but this pretty place and the hospitality of the people made up for everything!

Finally, after one and a half year, we got to travel to Maldives. Least I could do is capture these little moments of our much much awaited trip!! 

On this note, here's wishing that all you travel lovers can explore and wander once again, normally. Nonetheless, sanitize, wear your mask and stay safe! 💖
