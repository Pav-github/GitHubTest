Eid Mubaarak, everyone! ðŸŒ™âœ¨

This is the Great Mosque of Muhammed Ali Pasha or Alabaster Mosque. It is located in the Citadel of Cairo in Egypt. Being an ottoman mosque, it's architecture resembes a lot with that of the Blue Mosque in Turkey.

It's fascinating that the main material used in building the mosque is limestoneÂ , which was likely sourced from the Great Pyramids of Giza.
