Do you want to hit the beach too? 🌊
.
.
.
Countless people travel to Bali every year! Bali is one of our favourites too; however, if you do not explore the Gili Islands, your trip is incomplete. Out of the three Gili Islands in Indonesia, Gili Air is just a small 5 km peanut sized island. ⚓️
.
.
.
With Gili Trawangan speedily becoming a popular party island and Gili Meno primarily catering to couples; Gili Air gives you a relaxed pace of life attracting social backpackers who prefer to dive, meet other fellow travellers or simply want to chill out. 🤫
.
.
P.S: You can reach the Gili Islands via speed boat from Bali.⛵️
