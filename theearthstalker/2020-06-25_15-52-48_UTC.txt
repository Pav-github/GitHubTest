Have you been to Pattaya?

In a lockdown, sitting on a couch and reminiscing good times! We dug into our gallery to find this beautiful picture captured in Pattaya, Thailand. We were in a speed boat about to go parasailing for the first time. 🦋

The weather was pretty fair and you can see brightly-coloured parachutes criss-crossing the bay, each towed by a speedboat. For parasailing in Pattaya, they have pontoons a few hundred metres out into the water, from which you will be lifted into the air (unlike other places). All in all, it was an adventure and one of our favorite memories made in Thailand. ♥️
