Have you walked on the largest frame in the world?✨

.
.
The Dubai Frame is a beautifully architectured picture frame in Zabeel Park, Dubai. This latest attraction in Dubai, stands 500 feet high from the ground and offers panoramic views of the city's skyline. 🌟

Check the video to see how the Dubai Frame features glass-floored walkways and full-height views out to the old city of Deira to the north and the skyscrapers of Sheikh Zayed Road toward the south. Once mesmerized by the views from the top, a neon vortex tunnel ushers visitors into an interactive, augmented reality exhibition on the history and future of the city. 💫
