Maharashtra's most popular hill station, Mahabaleshwar in India, is a bountiful place to visit during the monsoons. Its blend of natural beauty, lush greenery, breathtaking valleys and old-world charm will just give you a mesmerizing and peaceful vacation.

While we were exploring this beautiful hill station, we captured this picture at a seasonal waterfall. The roads were completely enclosed with fog & incessant rain added to the beauty of this place. Although we have visited this place in the winters, adventuring here in monsoon is absolutely worth it! We had a fantastic weekend and we hope to travel soon!

While some cities/countries are safe to travel now, India is still going through a rough phase and we do not recommend unnecessary travel at this juncture. Please stay home and stay safe everyone! 😊
