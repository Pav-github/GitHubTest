French wine, poolside and the beach! 🤩

Who doesn't love sipping wine by a poolside? But there are some important things you need to know about alcohol in Maldives! Read on 🔻

Being an Islamic country following Sharia Law, alcohol is forbidden in the local islands of Maldives. Which means, you cannot bring alcohol to the country, not even from duty free (note that bags are strictly screened at the airport). 

Nevertheless, resorts in Maldives on private islands are not enforced by this law and the sale of alcohol is permitted on such private islands only. So you can freely consume alcohol only in the fancy bars of your private islands or from your minibar in your hotel rooms. 🍻

Despite the ban on alcohol, non-alcoholic beer is very popular in Male and on other inhabited islands. Cheers!! 🍻
