Guess who planned our Spiti trip?

This may look like an extended anniversary post, but it is NOT! This is more like an appreciation note to express my happiness and gratitude to Rohan for the amazing holiday he planned for our anniversary. We usually travel international in April, but for some reason we just couldn’t book our trip until a week before our leave date. Until the last hour, I was swamped with work and the Mr. took charge to plan this holiday this time around. I was so unsure if we would make it, but he said “ab nahi toh fir kab?” ☺️ 

I mean, sure, the weather was rough and the tour was pretty deadly, but thank you @frank8rohan for being my superhero throughout! I was sick most of the days, but you ensured that I was safe, comfortable and well-fed! I love and appreciate those silly jokes, cozy cuddles and crazy adventures we shared on this trip. Thank you for always being there by my side! I’d never want to travel solo, because I’ve found my ultimate travel buddy. 🧿

Here’s to many more wild and wonderful adventures together! 🥂
