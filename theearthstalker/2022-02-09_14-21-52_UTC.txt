Cutie from the jungle safari! ðŸ¦œ

It is a white-throated kingfisher and is also called a tree kingfisher. And I googled this because I forgot what the guide from the jungle safari said it was. ðŸ™ˆ In my defence, it was freaking cold and I only wanted to spot a tiger!! So, obviously @frank8rohan captured this birdie! ðŸ“¸
