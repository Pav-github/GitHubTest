Our 10th country together! 🇱🇰♥️

We planned to explore Sri Lanka in 2020. Covid happened and our trip was cancelled, not once, nearly thrice. The recent turmoil in the country also didn't let us explore the country last year.

Finally, here we are, in the pearl of the Indian Ocean, the Land of Serendipity - SRI LANKA.

It is just Day1 of our trip but this place is incredibly beautiful. We cannot wait to show you the charm of this Island country! ☺️
