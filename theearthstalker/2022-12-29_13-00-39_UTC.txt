It took ages to climb up that sand dune 😂😂

Sandboarding is a blend of surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding. And it’s freakin’ hard! Going down that dune standing is even tough, nonetheless, what an exhilarating experience!! 🏂

Over the past few months, we have not been very active, lost a lot of followers and our content gains less traction too. But not every video is shot for the gram and not every video is uploaded merely for some likes. This is what we are and these are the memories we’ve made in 2022! 💕

Wish you and your loved ones a fabulous 2023!
