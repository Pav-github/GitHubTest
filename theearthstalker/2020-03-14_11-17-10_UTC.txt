Trippy stairway at the New Light House in Pondicherry ‚ú®
‚ú®
Details :
‚ú®
‚Ä¢ While the Old Light House has been shut for tourists, the new one can be visited to have a spectacular bird's eye view of the city.
‚ú®
‚Ä¢ With around 230-240 steps inside the lighthouse and no elevator, it can get difficult to get to the top. Nevertheless, travel bugs like us will definitely make it to the top for the beautiful view of the city on one side and the sea on the other.
‚ú®
‚Ä¢ Open for visitors everyday, but only between 3pm to 5pm. So, plan your travel accordingly. (P.S: Since the lighthouse is at the extreme south of Pondicherry, you can next plan to visit the Paradise beach on the same day. üòä)
‚ú®
‚Ä¢ Minimal entrance fee of INR 10/- (and approximately INR 30/- if you're carrying a camera) is all you need to get in there. üòç
