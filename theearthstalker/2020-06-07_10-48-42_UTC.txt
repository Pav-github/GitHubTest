Ever stayed in a cave hotel? 😍

We stayed in a cave hotel in Cappadocia! Surely historic and primitive; nevertheless the suites are luxurious and are designed uniquely. Cappadocian region is known for its elaborate network of caves, with whole towns and villages carved underground and into the rock faces. .

The word ‘cave’ may not create pretty images in your head! But these cave suites are not cold, dark, damp places. Most of the cave hotels in Cappadocia are stunning, incorporating old cave features, while providing all the modern amenities you’d expect in a top hotel. 😍😍
