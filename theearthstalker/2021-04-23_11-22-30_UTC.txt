That's Dubai for you! ‚≠êÔ∏è

Most people prefer to visit the observation deck in the day. But the night view is so spectacular, you'd just not want to leave. So, when you @visit.dubai next, make sure you plan this at night and you can thank me later. üòÅ

Also, at night you can enjoy watching @thedubaifountain from top which is another brilliant visual to the eye. I can literally go on about this marvelous tower. But for now this is it! Do you think my next blog should be on Dubai? ü•∞
