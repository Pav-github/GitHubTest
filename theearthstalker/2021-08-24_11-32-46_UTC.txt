This is where we got tanned the most! ðŸ˜‚

With the sun right above our heads, we cycled all the way to the tip of the island. The route was scenic and had trees along the way, so we didn't quite feel the heat. But at this very spot, we were basking in the sun for more than an hour. While the tip of this island is so beautiful and breezy, it was hotttttttt!!! ðŸ”¥

All worth the pretty pictures though, isn't it? ðŸ¤©
