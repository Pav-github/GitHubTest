Noire - Little friend from France! .
.
.
We met Noire and her mommy on our trip to Ephesus in Turkey. She's an incredibly beautiful soul and an adventurous kid. Having done paragliding at the age of 6 and aiming to sky dive already, isn't something most children of her age do! 😁

Kudos to her traveller mommy @victorialeroys for this! We hope you guys are healthy and safe, much love! ♥️
