Has been a busy Monday for all I'm sure!

There are insufficient oxygen services, inadequate beds and ventilators as well as scarcity of injections for all. The Government was not prepared for this and we have been let down right now. 

REQUEST: Don't let that come in your way of helping others. Most of you went out of your way to help others in need. From sharing contacts to even reaching out to help, you tried your best. Let me tell you, that's commendable! And that's the perfect thing to do. You and I make this country, you and I can help more people and inspire masses to do so too. üíô

It sucks to see people pleading for basic necessities like meds, oxygen and hospital availability to content creators, influencers, and meme pages too. Saddest part we can't even do much. We cannot save all, but we can surely give our best to save a few lives.

Calling all you people who have a considerable amount of following to share and amplify any requests from your family or acquaintances and help each other through this.

BE KIND ‚≠êÔ∏è
