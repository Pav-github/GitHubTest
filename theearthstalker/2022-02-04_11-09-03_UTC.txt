Happy Friday, folks!! 🥂

We had a brilliant start to the year. After celebrating new year's eve with 'The Gang', we started to plan our first holiday of 2022.

@frank8rohan @deepika.indulkar and I had to exhaust our pending leaves, so @anjariakunal had to accompany us, with no choice! 😋

Initially, we started planning for Dubai - over ambitious, huh? 😂 Then we almost prepared a whole itinerary for Nepal, spoke to so many people there etc etc. Omicron came, and we chose to travel domestic - IYKYK!! 

So, we went on to look for places to visit in Meghalaya. Right when we were about to book, omicron cases started to increase tremendously. Which is why, one afternoon - over a group call - we all decided to rather go on a road trip! And Rajasthan was the farthest we could go - since we also wanted to spend a relaxing holiday!

This was somewhere in the second week of January, when @frank8rohan decided to buy a new car. Uff...lot of events occured in between - we sold our car, our new car wasn't available et al. Also, @kunal.pradhan and @bansodeakshay were the sweetest!! And and and...To our surprise, somehow, we got delivery of our car just 2 hours before we were about to leave for the trip. Of course, we had a fabulous holiday! 🚘

And this is how we spent our January! Sure you all must have had a good start to the year as well. Hoping that we all have a brilliant rest of the year too! 🍻💙
