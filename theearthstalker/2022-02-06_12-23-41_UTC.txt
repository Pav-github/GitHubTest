Patrika Gate is the entrance to the Jawahar Circle Park - which is the biggest circular park in Asia - located at a traffic signal.

Although Patrika Gate is open 24/7 on all days, make sure you visit in daylight. The interiors are intricate, beautiful and colorful, making this location a popular tourist spot in Jaipur.
