Perfect guide for your budget holiday in Maldives! 🇲🇻✈️

⭐️Choose direct flights, book at least 3 months before travel - Return flight cost can be as low as INR 15k per person. Check for cheapest flights on Skyscanner.

⭐️Plan your holiday between June to October which is off-season there.

⭐️Chose speed boat transfers instead of sea planes - Sea planes are a good experience but pretty expensive as compared to speed boats. For long journey, you can also opt for domestic flights which are much cheaper than seaplanes.

⭐️Local islands are where the local Maldivians reside, so accommodation and water activities at such islands is wayyy cheaper than private islands owned by resorts. The blue water and stunning landscapes are the same everywhere after all. 

⭐️Wisest decision to save money would be to split your stay between the different categories of rooms available on that island. This is because island villas are nearly half the price as compared to over-water villas.

⭐️While booking, opt for full board meals - Full board includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which are usually served as buffets. Half board includes two meals. But if you opt for the à la carte option, you will definitely end up spending much higher comparatively.

⭐️Always check online reviews of your resort/property on Trip Advisor, or other platforms. You can also compare prices online and with your local travel agent.
