Overlooking the Pattata Park tower, moments before our first ever adventure - the Tower Jump from the 56th floor. While people can enjoy a spectacular view of Pattaya city from the observation deck, thrilled adventure freaks opt to jump into its panoramic view. 😁😁

Will soon post a video of the tower jump 😍
(P.S: It's not too scary, you are strapped onto a harness and then zip lined from the 56th floor to ground level at a controlled speed)
