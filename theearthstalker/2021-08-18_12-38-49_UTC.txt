Sun, sea, sand & shells! 🐚

That's pretty much everything one can love about a beach, isn't it? Beaches in Maldives are full of beautiful shells and corals, you might want to collect and bring home all of them!! Some of you might also be interested in collection of shells, as a hobby.

Yes?? Read on!🔻

Even though a piece of coral or a tiny little shell on your mantelpiece may look attractive, the long-term consequences on the ocean and its inhabitants may be devastating. The removal of too many shells from coral reefs can disrupt the delicate balance of an already fragile marine ecosystem.

There is a lot more to this..you can read about coral harvesting or coral poaching for more detailed information! But again, leave those pretty shells and corals where they belong! 💖

⚠️ Also, note that it is ILLEGAL to cart along any form of shell, sand or corals back from Maldives.
