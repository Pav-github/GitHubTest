Can you believe this pretty “instagram-worthy” location is actually a dumping yard? 😇

📍 This is a Marble Dumping Slurry located in Kishangarh, Rajasthan.

It is approximately a 35 km drive from Ajmer. Plan your travel accordingly since the entry to this place closes at 5pm. 

For entry permit, you will need to furnish a government ID card to the security personnel at the location. No charges to be paid.

A couple of movies and a bunch of Punjabi songs have been shot at this location. This beautiful location is like the go-to place for pre-wedding photoshoots right now! 😋
