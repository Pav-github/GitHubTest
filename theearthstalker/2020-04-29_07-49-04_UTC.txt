The Singapore Flyer, an observation giant wheel, can give you breathtaking panoramic views of the entire city. Standing at nearly 165 metres from the ground, as the wheel turns, you will be astounded by the 360 degree view of nearly 15 iconic places in Singapore. Isn't that great? 😍 .
.
Cherry on the cake is that you can have a beautiful romantic lunch at the Flyer and feast on some of Singapore's famous authentic dishes. .
.
In frame, you can see the Flower Dome, which is another popular tourist destination in Singapore.

You can get to the Singapore Flyer by MRT, car or a taxi. And the Flyer is operational from 3pm to 9pm on all days.

Travel tip: It is at a walkable distance from the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Accordingly, you can plan to visit these 3 main tourist attractions on the same day. You can save on your cab fare 😁
