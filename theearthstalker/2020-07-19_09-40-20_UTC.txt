Have you read about Auroville?

In frame: Matrimandir (which is the Sanskrit word for Temple of the Mother)

Auroville was developed to be a universal town, where people of all countries live in peace and harmony, above all creeds, politics and nationalities. The purpose is to realize human unity. Isn't it interesting? ðŸ’•

Matrimandir is the heart of Auroville township in Pondicherry and holds spiritual significance for those who practice integral yoga. Matrimandir was established by Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) who also founded the well known Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry.

This picture was captured from the viewpoint constructed at the south of this gold dome structure. Matrimandir is surrounded by lush gardens; and the viewpoint offers a panoramic view of the structure and the beauty around.
