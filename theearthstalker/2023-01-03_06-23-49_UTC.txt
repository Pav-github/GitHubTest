While Egypt is a lot more than just pyramids and deserts, here‚Äôs our first day in Giza exploring the prominent pyramids of Egypt.

Day 1 : We arrived at Cairo airport and were chauffeured in a beautiful car to our hotel. We checked in @hayat_pyramids_hotel_lounge and spent the rest of the evening on the beautiful terrace of the hotel. The view was spectacular, it was the Giza pyramids. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Day 2 : We took a full day tour to the great pyramids of Egypt. This included the pyramids of Giza, Red pyramid and city of Memphis. Later, we proceeded for a tour of the Pyramid section of Dashur and Saqquara as well. We also visited The Great Pyramid of Cheops, followed by a visit to The Pyramid of Chephren and The Pyramid of Mycerinus which are in the Giza Pyramid Section itself along with Sphinx. On exploring the pyramids, we visited the Papyrus factory and Perfume factory as well. The same night we boarded a train for Aswan.

A complete itinerary for our Egypt travels to follow in phases. This was just Part 1. üòå
