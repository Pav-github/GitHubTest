One of the most beautiful beaches I've been to! 🏝

This is 📍Arambol beach in Goa. As compared to the other beaches of North Goa, Arambol is less commercialized. Owing to this, the beach is clean and less crowded. If you walk towards north of the beach, through a small stretch of shops, at the other end of the shoreline is a secluded location. The only way to reach this place is on foot. The path is narrow and rocky too! But, all worth the effort. 💙

With the beach in front of you, hills to the sides and a sweet water lagoon behind, this place is a must visit destination. 🏝

Have been here several times, however this time was special. This drone shot by @praneethcooool is 🔥
