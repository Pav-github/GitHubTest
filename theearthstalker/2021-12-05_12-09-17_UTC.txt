Although you can visit Kashmir throughout the year, in our opinion, November is undoubtedly the best time to travel to this paradise.

And we recommend November because:

✅ Until mid-November, it is Autumn in Kashmir and you can experience the beauty of the shedding of Chinar leaves. In the countryside, it is a beautiful sight when green turns to golden and then reddish-orange before turning brown and finally falling to ground.🍁🍂

✅ At the same time, Kashmir is also surrounded by lush greenery and picturesque landscapes at certain hill stations like Yusmarg and Doodhpathri. The Mughal gardens in Srinagar and valleys in Pahalgam are all a visual treat with its breathtaking vistas of greenery. ☘️🌲

✅ And the best part is that you can also enjoy snowfall at Sonmarg, Gulmarg and Baisaran valley in Pahalgam - like we did!!! ☃️🗻
