Our last trip before the lockdown - We were holidaying in December 2019 at Dubai. This picture was captured right before we hopped on a traditional wooden boat, popularly known as an Abra in the UAE. The Dubai Fountain Lake Ride is absolutely mesmerizing because you can admire the tall standing Burj Khalifa, Sook Al Bahar as well as enjoy grandstand views of the illuminations. Definitely can't miss the beauty of The Dubai Mall too üòç

In the abra, as the fountains lit up, we watched a stunning choreography of water and light, synced to beautiful Arabic music. The spectacular beauty of the place was breathtaking! ‚ô•Ô∏è
