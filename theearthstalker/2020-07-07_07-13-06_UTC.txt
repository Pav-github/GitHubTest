About the picture - This gloomy day, we were at the Taj Mahal in India admiring its architectural beauty and the pride of the Mughal empire. This crown of all the palaces stood as a magnificent piece of artwork and the clouds beautifully covered the sky to make this picture worth a lot of memories for us.
