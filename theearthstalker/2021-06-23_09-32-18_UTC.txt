The Earth Stalker turns 2️⃣

So grateful to each of you for staying with us and supporting our content even though we've been in a lockdown soon after we started this page.

Last year, we celebrated The Earth Stalker's first anniversary in a lockdown and we had our hopes high about traveling in 2021. And, here we are again! Nevertheless, lets hope for things to get better soooonnn. 🙃

Now I want to tell you how much I miss traveling...But I'm not going to be able to tell you that anymore. I'll just go cry now......brb 🥺
