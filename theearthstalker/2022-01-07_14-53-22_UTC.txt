That's what I look like 14,500 feet above sea level! 😂

Okay, some serious information:

Apharwat peak in Gulmarg receives heavy snowfall and remains closed most of the year. Fortune enough to have made it here on our trip to Kashmir.

Few things you might not know about this place:

📍It is remotely positioned near the Line of Control (barely few kilometres away)
📍 It is the longest ski slope in Asia
📍 You can reach here via a Gondola Cable Car - which is one of the highest cable cars in India
📍 You can do skiing, snowboarding, and other fun activities
📍 Basic food available at the top

How to reach : From Gulmarg ticketing counter you can buy a ticket for 1st phase. On reaching there you can purchase a ticket for the next level, which is the 2nd phase, also called Apharwat Peak. 

DM if you need any further details ♥️
