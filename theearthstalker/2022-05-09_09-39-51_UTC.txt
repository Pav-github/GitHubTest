Have left a piece of my heart at each of those incredibly mesmerizing places I‚Äôve been to! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Be it a popular tourist destination like Singapore, a lesser visited country like Egypt, or even a weekend getaway in my very own city, Mumbai. A zillion memories, emotions and remembrances are associated with every single place I‚Äôve traveled to. Every time we are back from a vacation, we reminisce those moments forever! Mumbai - I belong here, this is where I live! But, part of me is always elsewhere!! Part of me is on that beautiful beach in Thailand, part of me is exploring the streets of Malaysia, another part is adventurous at Singapore‚Äôs sentosa island. While part of me is admiring the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, part of me is riding a camel along the Giza Pyramids. And I‚Äôm still partly swinging off the abyss in Bali, and and also reliving those Capadocian days in Turkey.

Not sure what it means to you all, but travel is EVERYTHING to me! üôà‚ù§Ô∏è
