Happy Weekend, amigos! ♥️

We're here in Hurghada, Egypt, celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary. 🍻

Covid broke our anniversary travel streak and we had to spend two years in a lockdown. But glad that we travel all throughout the year now. 😊 In the last nine months, we've been to two countries and two beautiful states in India. 🙈

Cheers to another year full of travel, adventure, love and health. 😁
