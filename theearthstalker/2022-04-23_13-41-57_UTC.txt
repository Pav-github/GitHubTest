📍Luxor, Egypt

If you know me well, you know how crazy I am for balloons! Even today, I can buy balloons on the street for myself. 🙈 Given that, how can I miss an opportunity to fly in a hot air balloon!!

After our beautiful experience in Turkey, we had to take flight again! This time, we did it in Luxor, Egypt! ❤️ It was a different yet mind-blowing experience.

What was the difference?
📌The balloon ride was much cheaper in Egypt than Turkey
📌The maximum height that we flew was also 3 times lesser in Egypt
📌Owing to the low height (probably), chances of the balloon getting cancelled in Egypt due to weather conditions is veryy less.
📌No major differences, otherwise.
