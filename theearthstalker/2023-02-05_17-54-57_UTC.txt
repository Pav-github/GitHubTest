Memories from JAN’23 💕

If you know us well, we are extremely passionate about travel. We started #TheEarthStalker in 2019, but could not travel as much in the past few years. So, if there’s one thing we really want in 2023, undoubtedly it is TRAVEL!

The year has kicked off so well already. We could travel to Sri Lanka, a trip we had been planning since 2020.

Manifesting more travel, adventure and experiences this year! ♥️ Here are some of our best moments in January ☺️
