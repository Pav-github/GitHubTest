The skyscrapers you can see were once the tallest buildings in the world. Tourists are allowed to visit the Skybridge and observation deck of these beautifully designed Petronas twin towers, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. .
.
Travel tip: A pass is required to enter the bridge, so make sure to get there early as queues can be long. ðŸ¤—
